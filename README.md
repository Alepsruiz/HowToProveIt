# HowToProveIt
This repository presents the solutions to selected exercises of Velleman's (2nd edition) How To Prove It book.

Some comments I want to make: 
- Feel free to ask for the LaTeX code
- I have the "scratch" work for the exercises. If you would like to see that, please let me know
- If you make any improvement to the files, I would appreciate if you let me know. I will give the corresponding credit
